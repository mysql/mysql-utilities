Test case 5 - show topology - help
Usage: mysqlrplshow.py --master=root@localhost:3306 

mysqlrplshow - show slaves attached to a master

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --help                
  --master=MASTER       connection information for master server in the form:
                        <user>:<password>@<host>:<port>:<socket>
  -l, --show-list       Print a list of the topology.
  -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                        display the list in either GRID (default), TAB, CSV,
                        or VERTICAL format
  -r, --recurse         Traverse the list of slaves to find additional
                        master/slave connections. User this option to map a
                        replication topology.
  --max-depth=MAX_DEPTH
                        Limit the traversal to this depth. Valid only with the
                        --recurse option. Valid values are non-negative
                        integers.
  -p, --prompt          Prompt for slave user and password if different from
                        master login.
  -n NUM_RETRIES, --num-retries=NUM_RETRIES
                        Number of retries allowed for failed slave login
                        attempt. Valid with --prompt only.
  -q, --quiet           Turn off all messages for quiet execution.
