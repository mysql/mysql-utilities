Introduction
------------
The mysqlbinlogmove utility was designed to relocate binary log files to a new
location in a simple and easy way. The use of this utility is recommended when
you intend to change the base location for the binlog files (enabled with the
server option --log-bin) moving all binlog files to the target location and
updating all required index files. It is also useful to archive some binary
log files to a different location.

Note: In order to relocate all binary log files the mysql server must be
stopped. This requirement is not needed if only some of binary log files are
relocated.

The behaviour of the utility depends on the options specified. Use the
--binlog_dir option to relocate all binary logs. Use the --server option to
relocate all binary logs except the ones currently in use (with the higher
sequence number). The target destination directory must be specified as an
argument and other option can be used to restrict the binary log files that
will be moved, as shown in the following examples.

  # Move all binlog files to a new location (from /old/location
  # to /new/location).

  $ mysqlbinlogmove --binlog-dir=/old/location /new/location

  # Move all binlog files except the one currently in use to a new
  # location (from the server log_bin_basename directory to /new/location).

  $ mysqlbinlogmove --server=root:pass@host1:3306 /new/location

  # Move all binlog files within a specific sequence range (10-100),
  # except the one currently in use, to a new location (from the server
  # log_bin_basename directory to /new/location).

  $ mysqlbinlogmove --server=root:pass@host1:3306 --sequence=10-100 \
                    /new/location

  # Move all binlog files not modified in the last two days, except the one
  # currently in use, to a new location (from the server log_bin_basename
  # directory to /new/location).

  $ mysqlbinlogmove --server=root:pass@host1:3306 --modified-before=2 \
                    /new/location

  # Move all binlog files older than a specific date (not modified),
  # except the one currently in use, to a new location (from the server
  # log_bin_basename directory to /new/location).

  $ mysqlbinlogmove --server=root:pass@host1:3306 \
                    --modified-before=2004-07-30 /new/location


Helpful Hints
-------------
  - By default only binlog files are moved. To move relay log files or both
    use the --log-type option with the desired value.
  - By default the utility will try to automatically determine the base name
    for the binary logs and index files by applying the default filename
    formats and files location. If custom file names are used, you can specify
    them using the options --bin-log-index, --bin-log-basename,
    --relay-log-index, and --relay-log-basename, respectively for binlog and
    relay log files.
  - When the --server option is used by default binary logs are flushed at the
    end of the relocate operation in order to update the server's info. Use
    --skip-flush-binlogs to skip this step.
