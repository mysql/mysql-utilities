  --help                
  --candidates=CANDIDATES
                        connection information for candidate slave servers for
                        failover in the form:
                        <user>:<password>@<host>:<port>:<socket>. Valid only
                        with failover command. List multiple slaves in comma-
                        separated list.
  --discover-slaves-login=DISCOVER
                        at startup, query master for all registered slaves and
                        use the user name and password specified to connect.
                        Supply the user and password in the form
                        user:password. For example, --discover=joe:secret will
                        use 'joe' as the user and 'secret' as the password for
                        each discovered slave.
  --exec-after=EXEC_AFTER
                        name of script to execute after failover or switchover
  --exec-before=EXEC_BEFORE
                        name of script to execute before failover or
                        switchover
  --log=LOG_FILE        specify a log file to use for logging messages
  --log-age=LOG_AGE     specify maximum age of log entries in days. Entries
                        older than this will be purged on startup. Default = 7
                        days.
  --master=MASTER       connection information for master server in the form:
                        <user>:<password>@<host>:<port>:<socket>
  --max-position=MAX_POSITION
                        Used to detect slave delay. The maximum difference
                        between the master's log position and the slave's
                        reported read position of the master. A value greater
                        than this means the slave is too far behind the
                        master. Default is 0.
  --ping=PING           Number of ping attempts for detecting downed server.
  --seconds-behind=MAX_DELAY
                        Used to detect slave delay. The maximum number of
                        seconds behind the master permitted before slave is
                        considered behind the master. Default is 0.
  --slaves=SLAVES       connection information for slave servers in the form:
                        <user>:<password>@<host>:<port>:<socket>. List
                        multiple slaves in comma-separated list.
  --timeout=TIMEOUT     Maximum timeout in seconds to wait for each
                        replication command to complete. For example, timeout
                        for slave waiting to catch up to master. Default = 3.
  --new-master=NEW_MASTER
                        connection information for the slave to be used to
                        replace the master for switchover in the form:
                        <user>:<password>@<host>:<port>:<socket>. Valid only
                        with switchover command.
  --force               ignore prerequsite check results and execute action
  -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT
                        display the output in either grid (default), tab, csv,
                        or vertical format
  --demote-master       make master a slave after switchover.
  --no-health           turn off health report after switchover or failover.
  -v, --verbose         control how much information is displayed. e.g., -v =
                        verbose, -vv = more verbose, -vvv = debug
  -q, --quiet           turn off all messages for quiet execution.

Available Commands:

  elect       - perform best slave election and report best slave
  failover    - conduct failover from master to best slave
  gtid        - show status of global transaction id variables
                also displays uuids for all servers
  health      - display the replication health 
  reset       - stop and reset all slaves
  start       - start all slaves
  stop        - stop all slaves
  switchover  - perform slave promotion
