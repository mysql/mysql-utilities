mysqlslavetrx - skip transactions on slaves

Options:
  --version            show program's version number and exit
  --help               display a help message and exit
  --license            display program's license and exit
  --ssl-ca=SSL_CA      The path to a file that contains a list of trusted SSL
                       CAs.
  --ssl-cert=SSL_CERT  The name of the SSL certificate file to use for
                       establishing a secure connection.
  --ssl-key=SSL_KEY    The name of the SSL key file to use for establishing a
                       secure connection.
  --ssl=SSL            Specifies if the server connection requires use of SSL.
                       If an encrypted connection cannot be established, the
                       connection attempt fails. By default 0 (SSL not
                       required).
  --gtid-set=GTID_SET  set of Global Transaction Identifiers (GTID) to skip.
  --slaves=SLAVES      connection information for slave servers in the form:
                       <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                       <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>] or <config-
                       path>[<[group]>]. List multiple slaves in comma-
                       separated list.
  --dryrun             determine the transactions (GTID) to be skipped for
                       each slave but without effectively skipping them
                       (injecting empty transactions) - useful to test the
                       transactions that would be skipped.
  -v, --verbose        control how much information is displayed. e.g., -v =
                       verbose, -vv = more verbose, -vvv = debug

Introduction
------------
The mysqlslavetrx utility is designed to skip multiple transactions on slaves
in a quick and easy way. More specifically, it injects empty transactions
on the slaves for each GTID that will be skipped.

The utility requires GTIDs to be enabled on all slaves. It does not require
replication to be stopped. However, in some situation it is recommended.
For example, in order to skip a transaction from the master  on a slave, that
slave should be stopped otherwise the target transaction might still be
replicated (and not skipped).

Note: Only transactions (GTIDs) that were not committed can be skipped, since
two transactions cannot be applied with the same GTID. GTIDs already in the
GTID_EXECUTED set of a slave will be ignored.

The utility requires the specification of the GTID set to skip and the list of
target slaves as shown in the following example.

  # Skip the specified GTID set (three transaction: 10, 11, 12) on two slaves.

  $ mysqlslavetrx --gtid-set=ee2655ae-2e88-11e4-b7a3-606720440b68:10-12 \
                  --slaves=rpl:pass@host2:3306,rpl:pass@host3:3306

Helpful Hints
-------------
  - Use the --dryrun option to execute the utility in dry run mode and confirm
    which transactions would be skipped with the provided input values without
    effectively skipping them.

WARNING: Skipping transactions is a useful technique to recover from erroneous
situations with replication. However, it must be applied with extreme caution
and with full knowledge of its consequences as it might lead to data
inconsistencies between the replication servers. For example, if a transaction
that insert some data 'row1' in table 't1' fails on one slave and that
transaction is skipped to solve the issue, then that data will be missing from
the slave (and no longer replicated). As a consequence the data for table 't1'
will be inconsistent with the one on the master and the other slaves because
'row1' will be missing.
