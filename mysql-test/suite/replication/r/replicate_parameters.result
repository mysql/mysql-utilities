Test case 1 - use the test feature
# master on localhost: ... connected.
# slave on localhost: ... connected.
# Checking for binary logging on master...
# Setting up replication...
# Testing replication setup...
# Success! Replication is running.
# ...done.
Test case 2 - show the help
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --help                display a help message and exit
  --license             display program's license and exit
  --master=MASTER       connection information for master server in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>] or <config-
                        path>[<[group]>].
  --slave=SLAVE         connection information for slave server in the form:
                        <user>[:<password>]@<host>[:<port>][:<socket>] or
                        <login-path>[:<port>][:<socket>] or <config-
                        path>[<[group]>].
  --rpl-user=RPL_USER   the user and password for the replication user
                        requirement, in the form: <user>[:<password>] or
                        <login-path>. E.g. rpl:passwd - By default = rpl:rpl
  -p, --pedantic        fail if storage engines differ among master and slave.
  --test-db=TEST_DB     database name to use in testing replication setup
                        (optional)
  --master-log-file=MASTER_LOG_FILE
                        use this master log file to initiate the slave.
  --master-log-pos=MASTER_LOG_POS
                        use this position in the master log file to initiate
                        the slave.
  -b, --start-from-beginning
                        start replication from the first event recorded in the
                        binary logging of the master. Not valid with --master-
                        log-file or --master-log-pos.
  --ssl-ca=SSL_CA       The path to a file that contains a list of trusted SSL
                        CAs.
  --ssl-cert=SSL_CERT   The name of the SSL certificate file to use for
                        establishing a secure connection.
  --ssl-key=SSL_KEY     The name of the SSL key file to use for establishing a
                        secure connection.
  -v, --verbose         control how much information is displayed. e.g., -v =
                        verbose, -vv = more verbose, -vvv = debug
  -q, --quiet           turn off all messages for quiet execution.
Test case 3 - use the verbose feature
# master on localhost: ... connected.
# slave on localhost: ... connected.
# master id = XXX
#  slave id = XXX
# master uuid = XXXXX
#  slave uuid = XXXXX
# Checking InnoDB statistics for type and version conflicts.
# Checking storage engines...
# Checking for binary logging on master...
# Setting up replication...
# Connecting slave to master...
# Starting slave from master's last position...
# IO status: Waiting for master to send event
# IO thread running: Yes
# ...done.
Test case 4 - use the start-from-beginning feature
# master on localhost: ... connected.
# slave on localhost: ... connected.
# Checking for binary logging on master...
# Setting up replication...
# ...done.
